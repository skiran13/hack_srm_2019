# Track Me
## Introduction:
In today's world, smartphones have become an integral part of our everyday life. We make use of them for almost all our activities. So, in a way they have become our personal companion. Because of this, it becomes really difficult when an individual loses his/her smartphone.

## Problem Statement:
Finding/ tracking phone applications require active internet connection which might not be available all the time. In the play store as of today, there are apps which have been developed to help us find our phones in such a calamity. For example google has its own 'Find My Phone' app which allows you to access your phone via your google account. However one major drawback of these apps is that it requires your phone to have an active internet connection when they get lost, that is obviously not practical because not everyone keep their data switched on at all times. 


## Solution proposed:
We aim to track the lost mobile phone without an active internet connection in the lost mobile. We use SMS as a tool to communicate with the lost device and fetch its location repeatedly after constant period of time to get the current location of the device.

## Implementation:
We send a unique message to the lost mobile. The lost mobile will detect the unique sms and will in turn use it's GPS to send the google coordinates which can be used to track the lost phone without using Internet.

## Feasibility:
Almost everyone has a smartphone nowadays and hence it is feasible enough to be implemented on a larger scale.
