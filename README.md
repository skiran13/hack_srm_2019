# Track Me
In today's world, Smartphones have become an integral part of our everyday life. We make use of them for almost all our activities. So, in a way they have become our personal companions. Because of this, it becomes really difficult when an individual loses his/her smartphone.

Around twenty thousand people lose their phone every single day. And losing our phones is the worst nightmare anyone could have as most of our sensitive data resides in it. Trying to lodge a police complaint after losing a mobile phone is not really a good idea because the police department has bigger things to worry about. So we are left with no other choice than using Mobile Tracking Applications.

In the play store as of today, there are apps which have been developed to help us find our phones in such a calamity. For example google has its own 'Find My Phone' app which allows you to access your phone via your google account. However one major drawback of these apps is that it requires your phone to have an active internet connection when they get lost, that is obviously not practical because not everyone keep their data switched on at all times. 

So, we at #include<idea.h> aim to achieve all this without an active internet connection on the mobile. We use SMS as a tool to communicate with the lost device and fetch its location every minute to get the current location of the device and get hold of the thief.
